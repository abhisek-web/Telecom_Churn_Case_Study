# Telecom_Churn_Case_Study

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.

We have taken the following suggestive steps to build the model:
  1. Preprocess data (convert columns to appropriate formats, handle missing values, etc.)
  2. Conduct appropriate exploratory analysis to extract useful insights (whether directly useful for business or for eventual modelling/feature engineering).
  3. Derive new features.
  4. Reduce the number of variables using PCA.
  5. Train a variety of models, tune model hyperparameters, etc. (handle class imbalance using appropriate techniques).
  6. Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. 
  7. Finally, choose a model based on some evaluation metric.
